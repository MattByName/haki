#+title: Haki - A Pleasant, Modern Theme
#+author: Dilip


* üîñ Info
This is not any normal theme that looks "huh".

This is tailored for emacs in modern sense, with each element to look distinguishable and go in sync.

There is not much science or principle here, /it's just a theme and its your eyes, if they go in sync, whoami to stop?/

* üí≤ Tips
Since its new, there is not much, but I do have one surprise!
Since regions cover everywhere, you can customize it to your preference.

  - Use ~M-x #'haki-change-region~ to choose and set a color for =haki-region=.

  To make it persist on sessions, you need to add ~(setq haki-region "#hexvalue")~

  - Emacs on Terminal should support 24-bit colors.
  It displays all colors for me on ~foot~ terminal.
  If you have issue, You can try setting 'COLORTERM' environment variable to "true-color" : 
 ~export COLORTERM=truecolor~

  - Heading level will be similar everywhere (/org,markdown,eww,shr,info,news../), every heading faces inherit corresponding org-level.
    Editing org-level face will follow to all modes having heading, define your choice of font for heading.

    Eg: 
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ; Font for each level
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :font "Impress BT")

    ; Add fg and a face
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :font "Excalibur Stone" :foreground "#ab82ff")

#+end_src

 - For meow users, there is ~#'haki-meow-mode-line~ which can change the border (=:box=) of the mode-line according to the meow-states, with this hook:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'post-command-hook #'haki-meow-mode-line)
#+end_src

* üéñÔ∏è Inspiration
  - [[https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes][Prot's themes]] - I'm a fan of ~modus-vivendi~, but it lacked something for me, it simply lead me to create this theme. Nonetheless, Modus themes is a *Masterpiece*.
  - [[https://github.com/minad][Minad]] - If it were not for his packages, I wouldn't have loved Emacs this much to create a theme.
    Absolute gem! Most of the theme's customization is based on his packages.
