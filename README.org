This is not any normal theme that looks "huh".

This is tailored for Emacs in modern sense, with each element to look distinguishable and go in sync.

There is not much science or principle here, /it's just a theme and its your eyes, if they go in sync, whoami to stop?/

As a new theme, I have two things in my mind:
+ If community or many users, like the theme, I might go tweak and add more goodies.
+ If there is not much appreciation, I might modify and improve some pastel colors.

Theme is available in MELPA.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Option 1: Simply do (make sure it is in 'custom-theme-directory')
  (setq haki-region "#2e8b6d")
  (load-theme 'haki t)

  ;; Option 2: with 'use-package'
  (use-package haki-theme
    :config
    (setq haki-region "#2e8b6d"
    ;; If you skip setting this, it will use 'default' font.
    haki-heading-font "Comic Mono"
    haki-sans-font "Iosevka Comfy Motion"
    haki-title-font "Impress BT"
    haki-link-font "VictorMono Nerd Font" ;; or Maple Mono looks good
    haki-code-font "Maple Mono") ;; inline code/verbatim (org,markdown..)

  ;; For meow/evil users (change border of mode-line according to modal states)
    (add-hook 'post-command-hook #'haki-modal-mode-line)

    (load-theme 'haki t))

#+end_src

* üí≤ Tips
Since its new, there is not much, but I do have some surprise!

  - Since regions cover everywhere, you can customize it to your preference.
  Use ~M-x #'haki-change-region~ to choose and set a color for =haki-region=.

  To make it persist on sessions, you need to add ~(setq haki-region "#hexvalue")~

  - Emacs on Terminal should support 24-bit colors.
  It displays all colors for me on ~foot~ terminal.
  If you have issue, You can try setting 'COLORTERM' environment variable to "true-color" :
 ~export COLORTERM=truecolor~

  - Heading level will be similar everywhere (/org,markdown,eww,shr,info,news../), every heading faces inherit corresponding org-level.
    Editing org-level face will follow to all modes having heading, define your choice of font for heading.

    Eg:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ; Font for each level
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :font "Impress BT")

    ; Add fg and a face
    (set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :font "Excalibur Stone" :foreground "#ab82ff")

#+end_src

 - For meow/evil users, there is ~#'haki-modal-mode-line~ which can change the border (=:box=) of the mode-line according to the meow-states, with this hook:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'post-command-hook #'haki-modal-mode-line)
#+end_src

 - Just like a theme, if you are looking to try new font. I can suggest you to check [[https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive][Recursive font]]
   I use (fork) them patched with nerd icons in OnePiece style naming, check out [[https:github.com/idlip/code-d-font][Code D Font]]

* üéñÔ∏è Inspiration
  - [[https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes][Prot's themes]] - I'm a fan of ~modus-vivendi~, but it lacked something for me, it simply lead me to create this theme. Nonetheless, Modus themes is a *Masterpiece*.
  - [[https://github.com/minad][Minad]] - If it were not for his packages, I wouldn't have loved Emacs this much to create a theme.
    Absolute gem! Most of the theme's customization is based on his packages.
